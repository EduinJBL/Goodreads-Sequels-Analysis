Analysis on ratings for author's first and second books

Python Scripts do data wrangling: 
1. Books Import and Match
Import data on books and authors and match author's first and second books. 
2. Import data on ratings
Import data on ratings by user. Merge these with books data and output summary tables. 

R scripts do further analysis and create graphs.
